    <h2 class="about">Our shop</h2>
    <h4 class="about">We are centrally located in Des Moines, IA. This allows us access to I-35 and I-80 to easily be at most tracks same day. Our founders have been racing wheel to wheel for the past 10 years and have brought home multiple national titles. Through those experiences we decided to go into the business of helping others achieve their racing goals behind the wheel of a Mazda!</h4>
